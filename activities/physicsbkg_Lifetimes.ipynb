    "To find the distance a particle travels in one lifetime, you need to know the lifetime of the particle and the speed of the particle. Classically, the formula to find the distance travelled in one lifetime is $ d= vt. $ Where $v$ is the speed of light and $t$ is the time the particle lives before it decays. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in many particle physics experiments, the particles are moving close to (but always less than!) the speed of light and this means that they experience [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation), which means their internal clocks run more slowly. \n",

    "Suppose a particle lives for the length of time equal to its [mean lifetime](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/meanlif.html). This quantity is defined in the particle's rest frame, which means that the time that we measure in the lab (in our particle physics experiment) is generally longer. The really useful quantity we are looking for is the flight-length: the distance the particle travels between the time it is created and the time it decays. This flight-length is longer in the lab, because of the time dilation effect. The distance measured in the lab is the [mean free path](http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/G4UsersDocuments/UsersGuides/PhysicsReferenceManual/html/node13.html) and is given by\n",
